Hey bub, where are the grammars?
================================

The grammar source code is automatically generated by [PEG.js].

If you run `npm run gen-grammars`, PEG.js will run and dump JavaScript
files in this directory.  It will also execute prior to publishing the
module or when running `npm install` locally.

Check out the `scripts` key in `package.json` for more details.
